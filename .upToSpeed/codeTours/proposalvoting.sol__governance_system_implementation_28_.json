The contract includes features for **access control**, **voting power calculation**, and **security measures** like pausing.","title":"","id":"545"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The `ProposalState` enum defines the possible states of a proposal throughout its lifecycle. Understanding these states is crucial for analyzing the contract's logic and **potential security implications**.","file":"contracts/ProposalVoting.sol","highlight":[{"start":8,"end":8}],"title":"","id":"592"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The **ProposalVoting** contract defines two structures: `Proposal` and `VoterInfo`. The `Proposal` structure (lines 12-19) stores information about each proposal, including description, vote counts, end time, quorum, and a unique winner hash. The `VoterInfo` structure (lines 21-28) manages voter-specific data for each proposal, tracking voter counts, eligibility, and voting power. These structures work together to implement the voting system and maintain the governance process within the contract.","file":"contracts/ProposalVoting.sol","highlight":[{"start":12,"end":28}],"title":"","id":"571"},{"type":"highlight","description":"The **`createProposal`** function is responsible for creating new proposals in the voting system.
