We've examined a contract that provides a foundation for a governance token, implementing standard **ERC20** functionality with additional minting and burning capabilities. While the contract itself is relatively simple, it represents **voting power** within the broader **governance system**. Remember that the complex voting logic will likely be implemented in other contracts that interact with this token. As you continue your audit, consider the **security aspects** we discussed, particularly around **supply management** and **access control**.","title":"","id":"570"}]}
